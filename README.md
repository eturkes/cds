# Neurosymbolic Clinical Decision Support System (CDS)

> A research-grade backend pipeline that ingests unstructured clinical guidelines and continuous physiological telemetry, **autoformalizes** them into mathematical constraints, and runs **deductive verification** to emit mathematically-rigorous, *safe* care pathways.

This repository hosted the **Phase 0 Vertical-Slice MVP** — a headless execution engine wired to a stakeholder-facing visualizer that renders the autoformalization, abstract-interpretation, and SMT-verification pipeline in real time. **Phase 0 closed at Task 9.3.** The repository is now in **Phase 1**, which extends the vertical slice with HL7 FHIR R5 streaming ingestion, distributed-cloud (Kubernetes) microservice deployment, and ZKSMT post-quantum proof attestation. See §7 for the live roadmap; `.agent/Architecture_Decision_Log.md` ADR-024 captures the Phase 1 axis split.

## 1. Epistemic Framing (Read This First)

This is a **research prototype**. To prevent over-claiming:

- *Deductive reasoning* is performed exclusively by the **Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)** solvers (Z3, cvc5) and the **Lean 4** interactive theorem prover. These tools are sound w.r.t. their declared theories and proof systems.
- *Large Language Models* are used **strictly as syntactic translation agents**: natural-language guidelines → structured logic AST. Their output is verified by symbolic engines downstream; LLMs are never trusted for clinical reasoning.
- *Probabilistic and fuzzy components* (TSK fuzzy inference, HNN heuristics for MUC selection) are deterministic at evaluation time — they output crisp scalars consumable by SMT, never probability distributions left undecided.
- All algorithmic claims are bounded by what the underlying academic literature establishes for each specific tool. Nothing in this repo "diagnoses" or "decides" clinical care; it produces *machine-checkable proof certificates over formalized guideline fragments*.

---

## 2. Architectural Overview

The system is structured as an **Event-Driven Polyglot Microservices** pipeline coordinated via **Dapr Workflows** with language-agnostic sidecars.

### Verification pipeline (data-flow)

1. **Semantic Autoformalization** — natural-language guideline → First-Order Logic AST via the **CLOVER** compositional framework and **AST-Guided Parsing** (NL2LOGIC). The AST conforms to the **OnionL** traceability schema (scopes, relations, indicator constraints, atomic propositions).
2. **Knowledge Retrieval & Alignment** — medical ontologies extracted via **GraphRAG**, reasoned over with **OWL 2 EL** description logics through **ELK** (consequence-based) and **owlapy**; intersecting ontologies aligned with the **HermiT** engine.
3. **Continuous Bounding & Fuzzy Inference** — physiological domains constrained with the **Octagon** abstract-interpretation domain ($\pm x \pm y \le c$); probabilistic medical thresholds collapsed to deterministic scalars via **Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK)** fuzzy inference.
4. **Deterministic Rule Execution & Defeasible Logic** — real-time logical entailment in the **Nemo** main-memory Datalog engine; defeasible pathways via **Answer Set Programming** (clingo) with **ASPARTIX** argumentation; discrete implications encoded as **indicator constraints** to preserve linear relaxations.
5. **Mathematical Satisfiability & Bounded Model Checking** — AST → SMT-LIBv2 → **Z3** (CDCL(T), `check-sat-assuming`) over multimorbidity guideline composites.
6. **Unsatisfiable-Core Extraction** — Minimal Unsatisfiable Cores via the **MARCO** algorithm augmented with **Hypergraph Neural Network (HNN)** ranking heuristics and **CASHWMaxSAT** stratification.
7. **Formal Proof Certification** — deep verification delegated to **cvc5**, emitting **Alethe** and **LFSC** proof certificates; certificates routed to **Lean 4** via the **Kimina** headless JSON-RPC server for mechanical re-checking.

## 3. Conceptual Data Schemas

| Schema                        | Purpose                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ClinicalTelemetryPayload`    | Continuous floating-point physiological measurements + discrete patient events with temporal markers |
| `OnionL_IR_Tree`              | Hierarchical FOL AST with distinct node variants (Scope / Relation / IndicatorConstraint / Atom). JSON-serialized. |
| `SMT_Constraint_Matrix`       | SMT-LIBv2 string + linear-arithmetic theory namespaces + retractable `check-sat-assuming` assertions |
| `Formal_Verification_Trace`   | `{ sat: bool, muc: [textual_node_id], alethe_proof: <Lean4-ingestible serialization> }`              |

Concrete typed implementations land in **Task 2** (Rust structs + Python Pydantic models).

External binaries (cvc5, Z3, Lean 4 toolchain) are fetched into a project-local `.bin/` directory by `just fetch-bins`. `.bin/` is prepended to `$PATH` by the Justfile recipes.

## 6. Quickstart

```bash
# Verify host toolchain (uv, cargo, bun, just) and PATH wiring
just env-verify

# Phase 0 bootstrap: install local Python venv, fetch external binaries to .bin/
just bootstrap

# Lint everything
just lint

# Run all tests
just test
```

`just --list` enumerates every available recipe.

### Running Phase 0 end-to-end

The full vertical slice (telemetry → autoformalization → deduction → SMT
solve → Lean recheck → live UI) needs both daprd sidecars, the SvelteKit
adapter-node BFF, and a Kimina headless Lean server. Two close-out
gates exercise the stack:

```bash
# Wire-contract gate (Task 9.2): drives the canonical contradictory-bound
# fixture through the BFF via curl and asserts trace.sat == false +
# recheck.ok == true.
CDS_KIMINA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 just frontend-bff-smoke

# Visualizer gate (Task 9.3): drives the same flow through the live UI
# and asserts the unsat banner + ≥2 MUC entries + AST highlights via
# Playwright.
CDS_KIMINA_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 just frontend-pipeline-smoke
```

For interactive exploration, bring up the cluster + sidecars + BFF and
load `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`:

```bash
just dapr-cluster-up
just py-service-dapr   # cds-harness sidecar
just rs-service-dapr   # cds-kernel sidecar
just frontend-dev      # SvelteKit + Vite dev server on :5173
```

The page renders the OnionL IR tree (left), the Octagon abstract domain
(right), the verification trace banner (top), and the MUC viewer
(bottom); MUC entries cross-link back into the AST tree on click.

| 6    | Mathematical solver integration (Z3/cvc5, MUC, Alethe)           | **DONE** |
| 7    | Headless Lean 4 interop (Kimina JSON-RPC)                        | **DONE** |
| 8    | Dapr workflow orchestration (sidecar boundaries)                 | **DONE** (8.1–8.4b) |
| 9    | SvelteKit frontend wired to live backend                         | **DONE** (9.1–9.3) |

**Phase 0 closed at Task 9.3.** The stakeholder visualizer round-trips
the canonical `contradictory-bound` flow against a live Dapr cluster,
demonstrating the Plan §1 success criterion.

### 7.2 Phase 1 (Open)

Phase 1 extends the Phase 0 vertical slice across three architecturally-
independent axes per ADR-024. Per-axis tool selections are **not**
pre-locked here; each axis lands its own architectural-lock ADR
(ADR-025 / 026 / 027) at its first sub-task, bound by the
`.agent/Plan.md` §10 step 4 web-search discipline at decision time.

Each task is executed in its **own atomic session** under the *Context-Governed Re-Entry Protocol* documented in `.agent/Plan.md`.

---

## 8. Subprocess Defenses

External SMT solvers and Lean 4 instances are dangerous in long-lived processes if not carefully managed. The Rust kernel guarantees:

- **Drop-on-kill semantics** — every spawned `Child` process is wrapped with `.kill_on_drop(true)` (or equivalent for non-tokio handles), so a panic, abort, or scope exit guarantees solver termination.
- **Strict timeout monitors** — each solver call carries a hard wall-clock budget; expiry triggers `SIGTERM` then `SIGKILL`.
- **Thread-safe CPU isolation** — verification work runs in dedicated async process pools. Workers communicate exclusively via message-passing (no shared mutable state, no UNIX-signal handlers in worker threads).

---

## 9. Contributing

Phase 0 is a closed research prototype. Once Phase 1+ scope opens (FHIR streaming, distributed deployment, ZKSMT attestation), a `CONTRIBUTING.md` will be added with the public contribution policy.
